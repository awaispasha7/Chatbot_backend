# Consultation Scheduling Fix Guide

## üîß **Issue Fixed: Chatbot Now Actually Schedules Consultations!**

The issue you experienced has been resolved! Previously, the chatbot was only acknowledging consultation requests in the chat but not actually scheduling them through the system. Now the chatbot will automatically detect consultation details and schedule them properly.

## üöÄ **What Was Fixed:**

### ‚úÖ **Before (The Problem):**
- Chatbot responded to consultation requests with acknowledgment
- No actual consultation was scheduled in the system
- Admin dashboard showed no consultations
- No logging or notifications were sent

### ‚úÖ **After (The Solution):**
- Chatbot automatically detects consultation details in chat messages
- Actually schedules consultations through the API
- Logs all consultation activities
- Sends notifications to team members
- Shows up in admin dashboard immediately

## üîç **How It Works Now:**

### **1. Automatic Detection:**
The chatbot now uses intelligent pattern recognition to detect when users provide consultation details:

**Triggers:**
- Messages containing words like "schedule", "consultation", "appointment", "meeting", "call", "demo"
- Messages with name and email information

**Extracted Information:**
- Name (from patterns like "my name is", "call me", "name:")
- Email (standard email format detection)
- Phone (from patterns like "phone:", "contact:", "number:")
- Company (from patterns like "company:", "work at:", "business:")
- Date (from patterns like "date:", "schedule:", "appointment:")
- Time (from patterns like "time:", "at:", "around:")
- Message (project details or additional information)

### **2. Automatic Scheduling:**
When consultation details are detected:
1. **Extract Information** - Parse name, email, phone, company, date, time, message
2. **Call API** - Automatically call the `/consultation/schedule` endpoint
3. **Log Activity** - Record the consultation in the logging system
4. **Send Notifications** - Notify team members via email
5. **Generate Response** - Provide confirmation with consultation ID

### **3. Response Format:**
**Successful Scheduling:**
```
Perfect! I've successfully scheduled your consultation. Here are the details:

```

## üß™ **Test the Fix:**

### **Start your chatbot:**
```bash
python run.py
```

### **Test with the same message:**
Go to `http://localhost:8000/chat-interface` and send:
```
Hi, I want to schedule a consultation. My name is Shehryar, my email is shahzadashehryar16@gmail.com, 
my company is Softec Techniques, my phone is 555 2348769, and I'd like to schedule for September 29, 2025 at 7 PM. 
I'm interested in learning about agentic AI for our software development processes.
```

### **Expected Results:**
1. **Chatbot Response:** Should show consultation ID and confirmation
2. **Admin Dashboard:** Should show the consultation in `/admin-dashboard`
3. **Logs:** Should show consultation activity in recent logs
4. **Notifications:** Team members should receive email notifications

### **Run the test script:**
```bash
python test_consultation_scheduling.py
```

## üìä **What You'll See Now:**

### **Admin Dashboard:**
- **Statistics:** Total requests, pending requests, recent activity
- **Recent Logs:** All consultation scheduling activities
- **Consultation Requests:** Complete list with status management
- **Team Management:** Add/remove team members for notifications

### **Logs:**
- **File:** `consultation_logs.json` - All consultation activities
- **File:** `consultation_requests.json` - All consultation requests
- **File:** `consultation_logs.log` - System log file

### **Notifications:**
- **Email:** Automatic notifications to team members
- **Content:** Complete consultation details and contact information
- **Timing:** Immediate notification when consultation is scheduled

## üîß **Technical Details:**

### **Pattern Recognition:**
The system uses regex patterns to extract information:
```python
consultation_patterns = {
    'name': r'(?:name|i am|my name is|call me)\s*:?\s*([a-zA-Z\s]+)',
    'email': r'([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})',
    'phone': r'(?:phone|contact|call|number)\s*:?\s*([0-9\s\-\(\)\+]+)',
    'company': r'(?:company|firm|business|organization|work at|work for)\s*:?\s*([a-zA-Z0-9\s&.,]+)',
    'date': r'(?:date|schedule|appointment|meeting)\s*:?\s*([a-zA-Z0-9\s,]+)',
    'time': r'(?:time|at|around)\s*:?\s*([0-9]+\s*(?:am|pm|AM|PM|[0-9:]+))',
    'message': r'(?:message|details|about|regarding|project)\s*:?\s*(.+)'
}
```

### **API Integration:**
The chatbot automatically calls:
```
POST /consultation/schedule
{
    "name": "Shehryar",
    "email": "shahzadashehryar16@gmail.com",
    "phone": "555 2348769",
    "company": "Softec Techniques",
    "preferred_date": "September 29, 2025",
    "preferred_time": "7 PM",
    "message": "Interested in agentic AI for software development"
}
```
