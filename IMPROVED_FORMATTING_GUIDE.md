# Improved Response Formatting Guide

## üìù **Enhanced Formatting Structure**

I've updated the system prompt to provide better response formatting with proper paragraphs and bullet points where necessary.

### üéØ **New Formatting Structure:**

**1. Opening Paragraph**
- Clear explanation of the main point
- Context and introduction to the topic
- Professional, conversational tone

**2. Bullet Points (when needed)**
- Lists of features, benefits, or steps
- Clean dashes (-) for bullet points
- Concise, scannable information

**3. Closing Paragraph**
- Call-to-action
- Next steps or contact information
- Professional closing

**4. Line Breaks**
- Separate different sections
- Improve readability
- Create visual structure

## üìä **Formatting Examples:**

### ‚úÖ **Good Formatting Example:**

**Question:** "What is agentic AI?"

**Expected Response:**
```
Agentic AI is autonomous artificial intelligence that makes decisions and takes actions without constant human oversight. It can transform your business operations in several key ways:

### ‚ùå **Poor Formatting Example:**
