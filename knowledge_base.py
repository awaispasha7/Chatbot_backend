                - Autonomous decision-making capabilities

                2. Reasoning Engine: Performs logical inference and decision-making
                3. Planning System: Generates action sequences to achieve goals
                4. Execution Module: Carries out planned actions
                5. Learning Component: Updates knowledge and strategies based on experience
                6. Memory System: Stores and retrieves relevant information
